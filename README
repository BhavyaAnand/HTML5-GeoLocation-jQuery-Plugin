HTML5 GeoLocation jQuery Plugin
http://github.com/teleject/HTML5-GeoLocation-jQuery-Plugin

* See plugin's comments for more information.

* Demo coming soon, but here are some tips:

- To get plugin to work on YOUR own site, you will need to get a Google Maps API registered to your domain: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
- Use Microformats' hCard for addresses
- If possible, use longitude and latitude within hCard for quicker response times
